var causation = "NaN is the short form of Not-a-Number. isNaN method verifies if an input is number by type or not. It will show true if the input is not a number by type otherwise it will show false. Here, in this task, first input '11' is a string which is not a number. But the veriable a is reassigned with (2-10) which results in -8, a negative number. That is why the output of this task is showing false.";
